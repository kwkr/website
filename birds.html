        <h2>How it started?</h2>
        <p>For the last couple of weeks, I experimented with automated video generation. I noticed that a short,
            narrated form can be quite compelling for viewers. I already had some ideas for the main content, but I also
            needed something eye-catching in the background. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
                href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nK20apFeDkY">Minecraft</a>
            parkour footage is already all over the place, so
            I wanted to come up with
            something unique. Because of that, I started researching generative algorithms. When visualized, they look
            pretty cool and provide almost unlimited possibilities for randomization which means seemingly new content
            can be easily created. I stumbled upon a 2D version of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boids">boids</a> implemented by <a target="_blank"
                rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://eater.net/boids">Ben Eater</a>. After modifying
            it a bit, I could achieve some
            visually pleasing effects.</p>
        <video style="width: 400px;" src="2d-boids.mp4" loop controls></video>
        <p> It would be a lot cooler though, if this were done in 3D. The logic is very simple so nothing prevents me
            from introducing another dimension to it. With the help of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
                href="https://threejs.org/">Tree.js</a> the
            result that you can see at the top can be achieved. You will also learn a thing or two which you can later
            use for your own projects.</p>

        <h2>What you will learn?</h2>
        <p>
            A lot...
        <ul>
            <li>How to setup a scene, camera, lights.</li>
            <li>Rules of the boids algorithm.</li>
            <li>What is geometry, mesh, material, shader.</li>
            <li>How the rendering is done.</li>
            <li>How to move objects around.</li>
        </ul>
        I won't go through the code line by line. If you want, you can always download the source code yourself and run
        it. My goal here, is to give you enough information to start playing with it. If you are only interested in
        playing with the results, you can use the canvas at the very top. The "Controls" tab allows you to adjust
        different parameters of the simulation to see how it impacts the resulting behavior.
        </p>
        <h2>Lights, perspective camera, action!</h2>
        <p>
            First things first, we need to setup our rendering environment. There are a few parts to it. Scene is where
            we add all the objects that we want to show. Next we need a camera, that will capture only the desired part
            of our setup. The parameters that we specify when creating the camera will determine how will our view look
            like.
        </p>
        <pre><code class="language-javascript code">const scene = new THREE.Scene();
const camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera(75, window.innerWidth / window.innerHeight, 0.1, 2000);</code></pre>
        <p> Renderer is the
            workhorse of our setup. It renders to the canvas what we tell it to render. When creating a new renderer, we
            can use some canvas that we already have in our HTML document. What we see when we look at the results of
            the render, are images, that quickly change to give us the illusion of movement on the screen. The single
            such image is called a <b><i>frame</i></b>. Because it's a series of frames, we need to clear the display
            after
            each frame, in order to start fresh every time.</p>
        <pre><code class="language-javascript code">const canvas = document.getElementById('birdsCanvas');
const renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer({ antialias: true, canvas });
renderer.setClearColor("#000000");</code></pre>
        <p>
            Believe it or not, this is everything you need to start rendering. The stage will be empty at first, but we
            will take care of adding some elements shortly. Remember when I told you about <b><i>frames</i></b>? Let's
            see
            exactly what I meant when I said they a series of images shown to us one by one. The code below is the
            <b><i>rendering loop</i></b>. Maybe it doesn't look like much at first, but the magic actually happens with
            the <b><i>requestAnimationFrame</i></b> function call. This let's the browser know, that we want to render
            something and when the right time comes, browser runs the provided render function. Each render call
            schedules another one so we will run again and again until the user closes the tab. Painting is done at the
            end of the render call. Usually, before performing it, you might want to update objects on your scene, so
            the frame that will get painted differs from the previous one. For example if you have some object that is
            moving, you update its position by some amount. Because single render call is very fast, this update is done
            many times per second.Let's say with each frame the object moves to the right by 1 centimeter. If we repeat
            the move 30 times within one second, when it passes, the object will smoothly transition to the right by 30
            centimeters. This is how the illusion works. To recap: you update your objects and then the
            <b><i>renderer</i></b> renders a <b><i>frame</i></b> combining the scene with the camera.
        </p>
        <pre><code class="language-javascript code">const render = function () {
    requestAnimationFrame(render);
    /*
        ... updating the state of the animation happens here
    */
    renderer.render(scene, camera);
};
render();</code></pre>
        <p>However with the current setup we wouldn't render anything meaningful. We didn't add any objects to the
            scene! What do you want add first? Some cube? Or maybe some complicated model of a cat? That would be cool,
            but we would still only see darkness. Because of that, I would recommend starting with some light source.
        </p>
        <pre><code class="language-javascript code">// add light source
const color = 0xFFFFFF;
const intensity = 1;
const light = new THREE.PointLight(color, intensity);
light.position.set(0, 200, 0);
scene.add(light);</code></pre>
        <p>This is the first object, that we will add to our scene. We specify some initial properties, set the position
            for it and add it. Remember this step, because adding other interesting objects will be very close to this.
        </p>
        <p>Finally it's time to add something that we will see. Out implementation of the boids algorithm will include
            some boundaries. This is like a cage, within which all the action will happen. If some bird decides to fly
            away, the rules we set will make it come back.</p>
        <pre><code class="language-javascript code">// add boundary
const edgesGeo = new THREE.BoxGeometry(obj.boundarySize * 2, obj.boundarySize * 2, obj.boundarySize * 2);
const edges = new THREE.EdgesGeometry(edgesGeo);
const basicMaterial = new THREE.LineBasicMaterial({ color: '0x00ff00' });
const boundaryMesh = new THREE.LineSegments(edges, basicMaterial);
scene.add(boundaryMesh);</code></pre>
        <p>There are some common elements that we need to specify in order to create and object that will be visible
            when rendered. The object that we see is a <b><i>mesh</i></b>. It combines information about what is the
            shape of the object or <b><i>geometry</i></b> and the information about how does it look like called
            <b><i>material</i></b> (you can additionally boost your material with shaders which I will mention later).
            Because we are only interested in the lines of the boundaries, the process is a bit
            more complicated. The <b><i>geometry</i></b> that we create consists of two steps. Creating
            <b><i>material</i></b> is just a single step. We define it's color and that's it. Finally we compose the
            target object using both parts that we created. Afterwards we add the <b><i>mesh</i></b> to the scene. If
            you run the script now, you will actually see the boundaries being rendered. The information that you got so
            far would already suffice if you wanted to create some render. You could grab some <b><i>mesh</i></b>, pick
            some <b><i>material</i></b> and add it to the scene to see it rendered. But we are not stopping here. We are
            still far from finished and have many interesting problems to solve ahead of us.
        </p>
        <h2>Movement is everything!</h2>
        <p>There is a reason why TikTok is so popular, why Instagram is not only about photos anymore and why humans can
            recognize something moving so fast. In the era, when we don't have to worry about predators anymore, things
            that are moving are much more interesting than a static picture. This is why, in this part, we will animate
            some objects. As mentioned earlier, the illusion of movement can be created, where a small change is applied
            over and over again.

        </p>
        <pre><code class="language-javascript code">const geometry = new THREE.ConeGeometry(1, 3, 8);

function getNewBird(id) {
    const material = new THREE.MeshToonMaterial({ color: colors[Math.floor(Math.random() * colors.length)] });
    const mesh = new THREE.Mesh(geometry, material);
    mesh.castShadow = true;
    mesh.position.x = obj.boundarySize - Math.floor(Math.random() * obj.boundarySize * 2);
    mesh.position.y = obj.boundarySize - Math.floor(Math.random() * obj.boundarySize * 2);
    mesh.position.z = obj.boundarySize - Math.floor(Math.random() * obj.boundarySize * 2);
    const dx = (0.5 - Math.random()) / 30 + 0.1;
    const dy = (0.5 - Math.random()) / 30 + 0.1;
    const dz = (0.5 - Math.random()) / 30 + 0.1;
    const item = { shape: mesh, dx, dy, dz, id };
    return item;
}</code></pre>
        <p>We will be calling the function above to obtain so called <i>bird-oid objects (boids)</i> instances. You can
            already recognize some familiar elements like geometry, material and a resulting mesh. While creating a new
            boid, we place it in a random place within our boundaries by changing the <i>position</i> property on the
            mesh. The XYZ coordinates are not enough for performing magic. We also need something that will allow us to
            tell how the specific boid moves within the 3D space. We generate 3 additional values, one for each of the
            directions: dx, dy and dz. Together they form a vector, that describes in which direction and how fast the
            boid will be moving. The values will be added to the position on each update to create the illusion of
            flying. Finally we gather everything we know about this specific instance of a boid and put it in an object
            for convenience. The boids produced by the method will be collected in an array, so we can keep track of our
            birds.
        </p>
        <pre><code class="language-javascript code">const render = function () {
    requestAnimationFrame(render);
    for (const item of birdsObjects) {
        // (...)
        const shape = item.shape;
        shape.position.x += item.dx;
        shape.position.y += item.dy;
        shape.position.z += item.dz;
        // (...)
    }
    renderer.render(scene, camera);
};
render();</code></pre>
        <p>As promised, we update the render function to account for the movement. On each render call we go through our
            boids and update their positions according to the direction they are going. If we compose all three values
            together, the boid will seem to move in some direction with some speed. This is already interesting, but it
            can quickly become chaotic as the birds will fly in some direction and soon be gone off camera. This is a
            perfect place to utilize the boundaries that we created earlier and add some simple rules that will bring
            some order to our simulation.
        </p>
        <h2>Start with the basics</h2>
        <p>
            Let's define some simple function that will make our boids stay within designated area. Again, after it's
            finished, we will include it in our render loop, so it can take care of making sure the rules are followed
            on each iteration.
        </p>
        <p>
            The rule is simple. We defined a box and we want the boids to stay within that box. So for each coordinate,
            we check whether it's withing specified bounds. We don't have to adjust anything as long as the boid is
            inside. But once it's position is beyond our box, we have to act. Specifically, we will counter act. That
            means, if the boid crossed some line, we will slightly tilt it to go the opposite direction. We are not
            changing it's speed in a given direction at once because it would look artificial. Small tilts spanning
            across a few render calls will create a nice, smooth movement. Additionally, the adjust value is
            parametrized, so later when running the simulation, we can change how strong we want the movement to be
            counteracted and see how does the response look like. Just to illustrate the whole situation with a specific
            example: Imagine the boid is moving only along X axis. Every frame, it moves 10 units towards it's positive
            direction. For the sake of the example, we will set the boundary at 20. The bird starts at 0. After first
            update it's at 10. After second it's at 20. After the third, it's at 30 so we have to act. We decrease it's
            speed by 2 every frame. This way, the bird still moves towards the positive end, but it's progress is
            slowing down. The speed goes from 8 through 6, 4 and 2 until it eventually stops, reverses its movement and
            starts going the opposite direction. All the following rules we will make using the same principles.
        </p>
        <pre><code class="language-javascript code">function adjustForBoundaries(bird) {
    const shape = bird.shape;
    const adjust = obj.boundariesAdjust;
    if (shape.position.x < -obj.boundarySize) {
        bird.dx += adjust;
    }

    if (shape.position.x > obj.boundarySize) {
        bird.dx -= adjust;
    }

    if (shape.position.y < -PLANE_LEVEL) {
        bird.dy += adjust;
    }

    if (shape.position.y > obj.boundarySize) {
        bird.dy -= adjust;
    }

    if (shape.position.z < -obj.boundarySize) {
        bird.dz += adjust;
    }

    if (shape.position.z > obj.boundarySize) {
        bird.dz -= adjust;
    }
}</code></pre>
        <p>After the rule is ready, we can place it within our render loops. The function is meant to update a single
            boid, so we also need to make sure it gets called for each of them. By now you should already know what
            piece of code comes next:</p>
        <pre><code class="language-javascript code">const render = function () {
    requestAnimationFrame(render);
    for (const item of birdsObjects) {
        // our first rule
        adjustForBoundaries(item);
        // (...)
        const shape = item.shape;
        shape.position.x += item.dx;
        shape.position.y += item.dy;
        shape.position.z += item.dz;
        // (...)
    }
    renderer.render(scene, camera);
};
render();</code></pre>
        <p>The direction of the boid is updated accounting for the rule that we specified and the new dx, dy and dz
            values
            are used in order to update boid's position accordingly.</p>
        <h2>Rules aren't always bad</h2>
        <p>We know how to render stuff. We know how to make it move. We know how to influence that movement with rules.
            It's time to finally start talking about parts that make this whole simulation interesting. We need
            to create some rules which composed together will make our birds move in a realistic way. The basic <a
                target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boids">boids simulation
                description</a> requires three of them to be present:
        <ul>
            <li>cohesion - make the birds look for nearby birds and join them to form flocks.</li>
            <li>alignment - when in a flock, adjust the speed and direction to make it look like they are cooperating
            </li>
            <li>separation - the birds as individuals still need some private space, so make them keep some small
                distance between each other</li>
        </ul>
        The rules are surprisingly simple but can lead to some complex behaviors.
        </p>
        <p>Let's define the <b>cohesion</b> rule. It goes like this: Check which boids are within a given distance from
            the current boid. The radius that we are going to consider is parametrized by the <i>obj.visibility</i>
            param. <i>distanceVector</i> function calculates the distance between two points in 3D space. If a boid is
            within this radius, we consider it part of the flock. In this case we need to find the average position of
            the flock and adjust the movement to fly towards this position. If we found any potential flock-mates, we
            adjust our movement to go into direction of the prospective flock. The <i>adjust</i> param will allow us to
            control how strong the boids should be seeking for forming flocks. Note that when making the final
            adjustment, we subtract our current position from the average position. This is because our goal is to go
            into direction of the flock. If we didn't subtract out current position, we would aim at some position
            outside the flock and it's not what we want.</p>
        <pre><code class="language-javascript code">function adjustForFlock(i) {
    const adjust = obj.flockAdjust;
    let cx = 0;
    let cy = 0;
    let cz = 0;

    let count = 0;
    for (const c of birdsObjects) {
        if (c.id !== i.id) {
            if (distanceVector(i.shape.position, c.shape.position) < obj.visibility) {
                count++;
                cx += c.shape.position.x;
                cy += c.shape.position.y;
                cz += c.shape.position.z;
            }
        }
    }

    if (count > 0) {
        i.dx += adjust * ((cx / count) - i.shape.position.x);
        i.dy += adjust * ((cy / count) - i.shape.position.y);
        i.dz += adjust * ((cz / count) - i.shape.position.z);
    }
}</code></pre>

        <p><b>alignment</b> rule looks very similar. The only difference is the goal. We want the boid to adjust its
            speed to the flock. WE WANT ORDER and anything that goes too fast or too slow would break it. To achieve
            this,
            we are looking for the average speed with which the flock is going. Again, we look through nearby
            boids, we collect their speeds and adjust the speed of the current boid according to the average. Same as
            above,
            the final adjustment also takes into consideration the current speed at which our boid is going. If we
            didn't account for that, the adjustment would be too big and would lead to some strange behavior being
            displayed.
        </p>

        <pre><code class="language-javascript code">function adjustAlignment(i) {
    const adjust = obj.alignmentAdjust;
    let cx = 0;
    let cy = 0;
    let cz = 0;

    let count = 0;

        if (c.id !== i.id) {
            if (distanceVector(i.shape.position, c.shape.position) < obj.visibility) {
                count++;
                cx += c.dx;
                cy += c.dy;

        <p>And the final rule: <b>separation</b>. Again we consider all nearby boids and try to keep at least
            <i>obj.minDistance</i> from them. If we are too close, we adjust the speed into the opposite direction a
            bit. Note that in case of cohesion, we subtracted our position from the average position of the flock. This
            time it's the other way around. We subtract the position of other boids from our position. This way the
            resulting speed vector pushes us away from the boids that are too close. Signs matter a lot!
        </p>

        <pre><code class="language-javascript code">function adjustForDistance(i) {

    let count = 0;

        <h2>Putting it all together</h2>
        <p>You have seen this fragment so many times, that this step should be a formality to you. You would be able to
            blindly tell where should we put our newly defined rules. There is one simple rule that I skipped here. To
            keep the simulation perceivable, we need to set a max limit on the speed at which the boids are moving. As a
            simple exercise, you can either try implementing it yourself or just look at the full source code. After
            you've done that, you can try turning the rules on and off and see what happens when some of them are not
            enforced. To say that the results are amusing is definitely an understatement.</p>
        <pre><code class="language-javascript code">const render = function () {
    requestAnimationFrame(render);

        adjustForBoundaries(item);

        adjustForFlock(item);
        adjustAlignment(item);

        <h2>Pimp my birds</h2>
        <p>Are you happy with yourself? "What's there to be happy about? Job's not finished. Job finished? No, I don't
            think so."There are a few final touches
            that we need to add in order to call the job done. It works, but it's not as pretty as it could be. Our bird
            are cone-shaped so we definitely have some potential there. Also I promised you shaders, so we need to
            mention them as well.</p>
        <p>Just to remind you, each boid carries with it some piece of information namely its speed in all directions.
            This is very valuable when it comes to the aesthetics of our simulation. Wouldn't it be awesome, if our
            birds point to the direction they are going to with their pointy cone ends? This sounds daunting but it's
            very straightforward to implement.</p>
        <pre><code class="language-javascript code">const render = function () {
    requestAnimationFrame(render);
    for (const item of birdsObjects) {
        adjustForBoundaries(item);
        adjustForFlock(item);

        adjustForDistance(item);

        shape.position.x += item.dx;
        shape.position.y += item.dy;
        shape.position.z += item.dz;
        // (...)
        // point into the direction of movement.
        const direction = new THREE.Vector3(item.dx, item.dy, item.dz);
        direction.normalize();
        const forward = new THREE.Vector3(0, 1, 0);
        const quaternion = new THREE.Quaternion();
        quaternion.setFromUnitVectors(forward, direction);
        shape.quaternion.copy(quaternion);
    }
    renderer.render(scene, camera);

        <p>Oh boi, how many times did we already see this? But there is a reason to it. You can actually say your whole
            simulation lives in here. That's why we added some changes here. Given the information about speed in
            different directions, we can construct a vector that tells us where a bird is going. We use this
            information, to rotate our mesh with it's pointy end facing the desired direction. Don't be scared of the
            quaternions. They are there to make your work with 3D rotations easier. In simple words, they are used to
            describes operation needed to go from one orientation to another. You take an start vector, you take the
            target
            vector and the quaternion tells you how you can land where you want to land. The rotation is finalized, when
            we call the <i>copy</i> method. With this change, our birds will look much more alive!</p>
        <p>As the last part we will take the boids out of a void and place them in a real world. To do this, we will
            give them some fake ground underneath and a fake sky.</p>
        <p>Creating a ground is super simple. Same process of creating a mesh again. You create a plane geometry first,
            a simple green material next, you connect them in a mesh and add to the scene. After adjusting the position
            a bit, it's ready to be rendered.</p>
        <pre><code class="language-javascript code">// add bottom plane
const planeGeometry = new THREE.PlaneGeometry(2000, 2000);
const planeMaterial = new THREE.MeshPhongMaterial({ color: '#0ad34b' });
const plane = new THREE.Mesh(planeGeometry, planeMaterial);
plane.rotation.x = degreesToRadians(90);
plane.position.y = -PLANE_LEVEL - 20;
scene.add(plane);</code></pre>
        <p>It gets more fun when creating a sky. Rendering is all about cheating. You use some seemingly unrelated
            things and make them pretend to be someone else. To create a sky, we take a sphere. Then we make it big
            enough to contain our microcosmos and put everything in the middle. We paint it blue from the inside and
            voilà! From the boids perspective it looks like they have a nice spherical sky above them.</p>
        <pre><code class="language-javascript code">// create sky
            const skyMaterial = new THREE.ShaderMaterial({
            vertexShader,
            fragmentShader,
            side: THREE.BackSide
        });
        const skyGeometry = new THREE.SphereGeometry(500, 32, 32);
        const skyMesh = new THREE.Mesh(skyGeometry, skyMaterial);
        scene.add(skyMesh);</code></pre>
        <p>Do I really have to go over creating a mesh again? Okay, take the geometry, take the material, combine it in
            a mesh and add it to the scene... Wait! There is something strange with the material over there! I can
            finally see a shader mentioned! But what exactly is it? Or what are THEY? In simple terms, they are programs
            (not necessarily small and THEY because they often come in pairs) that determine how the material looks
            like. The cool thing about them is they are meant to be run fast in parallel on the GPU and can take many
            different inputs (like time and textures) to produce awesome visual effects. If you want to see what
            they
            are capable of, I strongly recommend checking out <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
                href="https://www.shadertoy.com/">Shadertoy</a>. In our case they simply produce a blue gradient, but
            this is a very primitive example. Yet you have to start somewhere.</p>

        <h2>Summary</h2>
        So that's it. With this lengthy article we were not only able to build a funny toy to play with, but also learn
        a few neat things that will allow you to start creating your own experiments. I strongly recommend downloading
        the full code and trying to modify it and see what happens. The possibilities are endless. You can add a
        predator among the birds that they will try to avoid or maybe some obstacles just to see the result. The best
        thing about it is that you can just run it in your browser. You don't need anything else beside the thing that
        you use daily.
